# 🧠 Reverse Learning Plan: maildir2mbox.py

This guide provides a structured learning path to help you master all the skills involved in building the `maildir2mbox.py` script — from basic Python to advanced email parsing and CLI tooling.

This is the path I had to go while developing this project.

## 🧙‍♂️ Motivation

You’ve already reverse-engineered a real-world problem and solved it with code. That’s not beginner-level — that’s engineering.  
Take it further, build tools for others, and share them.  
That’s the way of the modern software alchemist. 🔥
